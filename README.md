Hi, my name is Alexandros Peteinaris and I'm enrolled in Coding Factory, a cutting-edge full-stack web application program provided by the Athens University of Economics and Business. I'm passionate about programming and creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. With a strong foundation in Java and web development, I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to enhance my skills and knowledge. I enjoy working in a team environment and collaborating with others to achieve our goals. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks.
